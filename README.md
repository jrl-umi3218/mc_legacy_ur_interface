# ur_modern_driver

This package is a ROS-free refactoring of the original deprecated driver https://github.com/ros-industrial-attic/ur_modern_driver.
It is intended to be used with UR10 CB2 variants whose Polyscope version is <= 1.8.x. As these robots cannot be upgrade to the new driver, we unfortunately need to maintain this version. The code in this repository was initially part of https://gite.lirmm.fr/rpc/robots/api-driver-ur.
